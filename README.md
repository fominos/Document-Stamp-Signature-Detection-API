# Document-Stamp-Signature-Detection-API
A production-ready FastAPI service for automated detection of stamps and signatures in documents. This project enhances a pre-trained YOLO model through fine-tuning on 1,100 real documents, significantly improving detection accuracy for seals and adding new signature recognition capabilities.
